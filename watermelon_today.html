<h3>Growing a Watermelon</h3>
<p>There are three things you need to grow a Watermelon:
  <ol>
    <li>Sun
    </li>
    <li> Bees</li>
    <li> Water</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Farmers generally grow watermelon in rows that are eight to twelve feet apart. The rows are usually made up of raised beds four to twelve inches high.Watermelon plants are grown in a nursery, then transplanted into these soil beds.
In order for a plant to fruit, a honeybee must pollinate the plant. within a month, the vine spread around eight feet. Within sixty days, the vine should show its first watermelons. The crop will is ready to harvest within three months.
Because the rind of a watermelon is not tough, they are handpicked. A ripe watermelon has a yellow spot from growing on the ground; this is what watermelon pickers look for.
